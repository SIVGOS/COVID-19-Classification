# COVID-19-Classification
A model is created which can tell whether any given Chest X-Ray image is "Covid-19 Positive" or "Pneumonia" or "Normal". 

There are only these three classes and each image can belong to only one class. You are required to use only the shared data for training purpose.

The code automatically downloads the data which is available at a shared folder.

Approach used:
The model is built on a Inception V2 imagenet. The last 18 layers of the model are trained. In addition, two dense layers are added.
The accuracy achieved is 91%.

Colaborators are welcome who may help me in improving the network.
